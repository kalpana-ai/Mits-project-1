## Overview
*Mits Project 1* is a sentiment analysis project that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze reviews and determine their sentiment. The project consists of two main scripts: `generate_reviews_csv.py` and `sentiment_analysis.py`.

## Key Features
* üìä Generates reviews in CSV format
* üìà Performs sentiment analysis using NLTK's VADER sentiment intensity analyzer
* üìä Saves sentiment analysis results in a CSV file
* üìä Utilizes pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

## Technology Stack
* Backend: Python
* ML: NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Libs: Pandas

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kalpana-ai/Mits-project-1`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas nltk matplotlib seaborn`
3. Download the NLTK data: `python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon stopwords`
4. Run the `generate_reviews_csv.py` script to generate reviews in CSV format
5. Run the `sentiment_analysis.py` script to perform sentiment analysis
